swift-weather-website.herokuapp.com

This website was developed as part of the 'The Complete Node.js Developer' Course.

This website allows you to enter a location. It then makes a call the Mapboz API to geocode the location. The result of this call is then sent to Weatherstack API to get the real time weather data for that location. The weather data is then presented to the user.

  - Callbacks
  - Setting up a web server with Express
  - Creating dynamic web pages
  - Handlebars
  - Git
  - Deploying application to heroku
